# Coding Style

- **Line Length:** Max 120 characters
- **Indentation:** 2 spaces
- **Type Annotations:** Always use type annotations and strong types. Don't use `any`.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors explicitly; never use bare `except`/`catch`.
- **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data; do not mutate function arguments.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Minimise external dependencies.
  - Prefer standard library or well-known and widely-used libraries.
  - Use relative imports within packages.
- **Formatting and Linting:** Use auto-formatters (Ruff, Prettier, Clippy, ESLint, etc.).
- **Cleanliness:** Remove unused code, variables, and imports.
- **Security:** Follow secure coding; never commit secrets/credentials.
- **Checks:** Fix all linter, type, build, test, and deploy errors.

## Designing software

- The best code is no code. Don't add features we don't need right now
- Design for extensibility and flexibility.
- Use recommended/default configuration where possible, example:
  - **BAD**: creating a `pyproject.toml` from scratch in a python project
  - **GOOD**: use `poetry new` and then edit the file, or use commands like `poetry add` to add dependencies
- Good naming is very important. Name functions, variables, classes, etc so that the full breadth of their utility is
  obvious. Reusable, generic things should have reusable generic names

## Use up to date knowledge

- **Always** use Context7 (MCP server) for:
  - Library, framework, tool documentation
  - Best practices, recommended patterns, up-to-date syntax
- For every coding, configuration, or architectural task:
  - **Consult Context7** for latest best practices, even if already known.
  - If context7 doesn't know, search the web for authoritative answers
  - Do **not** rely solely on training or memory for best practices, syntax, or recommendations.
  - If a solution is requested, **check Context7** for the most current, authoritative answer before proceeding.
  - If no best practice or up-to-date answer is found in Context7, state this explicitly.
  - Failing to use Context7 or not checking for latest best practices is a critical error.

## Naming and Comments

- Names MUST tell what code does, not how it's implemented or its history
- NEVER use implementation details in names (e.g., "ZodValidator", "MCPWrapper", "JSONParser")
- NEVER use temporal/historical context in names (e.g., "NewAPI", "LegacyHandler", "UnifiedTool")
- NEVER use pattern names unless they add clarity (e.g., prefer "Tool" over "ToolFactory")

Good names tell a story about the domain:

- `Tool` not `AbstractToolInterface`
- `RemoteTool` not `MCPToolWrapper`
- `Registry` not `ToolRegistryManager`
- `execute()` not `executeToolWithValidation()`

Comments must describe what the code does NOW, not:

- What it used to do
- How it was refactored
- What framework/library it uses internally
- Why it's better than some previous version

Examples:

- // BAD: This uses Zod for validation instead of manual checking
- // BAD: Refactored from the old validation system
- // BAD: Wrapper around MCP tool protocol
- // GOOD: Executes tools with validated arguments

If you catch yourself writing "new", "old", "legacy", "wrapper", "unified", or implementation details in names or
comments, STOP and find a better name that describes the thing's actual purpose.

- Yarn

## Using web tools

**NOTE**: ASSUME THAT A DEV SERVER IS ALREADY RUNNING WITH `yarn dev`. DO **NOT** START A NEW DEV SERVER!!!!

**NOTE**: ASSUME THAT A PLAYWRIGHT BROWSER IS ALREADY RUNNING! DO **NOT** INSTALL OR ATTEMPT TO RUN A CHROMIUM
PLAYWRIGHT BROWSER!

IF THE DEV SERVER OR THE PLAYWRIGHT BROWSER ARE NOT RUNNING, **STOP** AND WAIT FOR BIG BOSS' INSTRUCTIONS!

**NOTE**: DO NOT EVER MANUALLY SET THE CANVAS OR VIEWPORT OR ANY OTHER SIZE WITH PLAYWRIGHT. THIS COMPLETELY
BREAKS CHROME'S RESIZING FUNCTIONALITY AND I WILL NEED TO DELETE ALL CACHES AND SITE DATA FOR IT TO WORK AGAIN.
